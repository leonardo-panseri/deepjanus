# Probabilistic DeepJanus

## General Information
This repository contains the tools and the data of master's degree thesis "Automated detection of probabilistic behavior 
boundaries of ML-enabled autonomous systems" by Leonardo Panseri at Politecnico di Milano.

This project is based on previous research conducted by V. Riccio and P. Tonella at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana.
You can read more in the paper "Model-based Exploration of the Frontier of Behaviours for Deep Learning System Testing",
published in the [Proceedings of the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE 2020)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3368089.3409730).

The goal of this project is to characterize in a probabilistic way inputs of an autonomous system that may cause problems.
This is done by modeling the input domain and exploring it with a genetic algorithm.

## Repository Structure
The project is structured as follows:

* [__DeepJanus__](/DeepJanus) contains the DeepJanus core package that provides a way to easily adapt DeepJanus to specific problems;
* [__DeepJanus-BNG__](/DeepJanus-BNG) contains the DeepJanus tool adapted to the self-driving car case study;
* [__DeepJanus-MNIST__](/DeepJanus-MNIST) contains the DeepJanus tool adapted to the handwritten digit classification case study;
* [__experiments__](/experiments) contains the raw experimental data reported in the paper and the scripts to obtain the data.

_Note:_ each sub-package contains further specific instructions.
